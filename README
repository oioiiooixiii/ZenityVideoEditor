Simple, extensible, FFmpeg video editor, using Zenity as front-end. 
- Functional video trimming, but may contain bugs and malformed features.
- Extensible modularity was an afterthought, and as such, some inappropriate structures exist.
- A necessary temp file is created in '/dev/shm' and this location should be changed if '/dev/shm' does not exist.

Run 'zenityVideoEditor.sh'
